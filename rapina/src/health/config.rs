//! Health check configuration types.
//!
//! This module defines the types used to register custom health checks
//! with the [`HealthRegistry`], which is stored in application state and
//! queried on every `GET /__rapina/health` request.

/// A boxed async function that returns `true` if the check passes, `false` otherwise.
///
/// This is the internal representation of a registered health check after type-erasure.
pub type HealthCheckFn = Box<dyn Fn() -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = bool> + Send>> + Send + Sync>;

/// Registry of named custom health checks stored in application state.
///
/// Each check is an async function that returns `true` when healthy.
/// The registry is populated via [`Rapina::add_health_check`](crate::app::Rapina::add_health_check)
/// and automatically placed in state when `.with_health_check(true)` is set.
///
/// On each request to `/__rapina/health`, all registered checks are called
/// and their results are included in the response under the `"checks"` key.
